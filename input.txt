Animals trapped behind bars at the zoo
Need to run rampant and free!
Predators live on the prey they pursue!
This time the predator's me!

Lust, like a raging desire
Fills my whole soul with it's curse!
Burning with primitive fire
Berserk and perverse!

Tonight I'll plunder heaven blind
Steal from all the gods!

Tonight I'll take from all mankind
Conquer all the odds!

And I feel I'll live on forever
With Satan himself by my side!

And I'll show the world
That tonight and forever
The name to remember's
The name Edward Hyde!

What a feeling to be so alive!
I have never seen me so alive!
Such a feeling of evil inside

That's the feeling
Of being
Edward Hyde!!!
